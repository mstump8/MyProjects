#### This repository showcases three of my python projects: NJCities, MultiplePythonLibraries, and ToDoLists.

## NJCities
* https://github.com/mstump8/NJCities.git
* Description: The idea for this project is to compare the connection between population and crime rates within New Jersey cities. The purpose is to showcase how the population of a city does not affect the statistical crime rate, and that just because one city has more people, it does not mean they suffer from more crime.



## MulitplePythonLibraries
* https://github.com/mstump8/MultiplePythonLibraries.git
* Description: The Beautiful Soup code analyzes the text of The Declaration of Independance. It finds the title, the first header, different elements, and even finds the top 10 used words. The Pendulum code compares different time zones around the world. It also gathers the time zone of the user and allows them the choice to compare different time zones they want to see. The Pillow code uploads two dependency image files. This code filters and enhances both photos in different ways including cropping, brightness, color, contrast, and sharpness.



## ToDoLists
* https://github.com/mstump8/ToDoLists.git
* Description: The idea for this project is to address a social challenge of procrastination. By creating a to do list, it will help those who struggle with this have more organization and time management while also not feeling like they are drowning in so much work at once.
